#include <iostream>

	//I'm thinking we should try to have main be a driver program, with
	//functions that carry out the majority of the program.
	//This will make it far easier to test our own codes independantly.
	//Not everything will need a function (such as dialogue), but at least for
	//the map, dungeon/puzzles, etc. it'll be a good idea.
